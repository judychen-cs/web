    <h3> Here are some commonly asked questions about balloon dresses, that will serve as a table of contents for my report.</h3>
      <h4> <ul>
   <li> Will the balloons pop if you sit down while wearing a balloon dress?</li>
   <li> How much do balloon dresses cost?</li>
   <li> What if I'm allergic to latex?</li>

<h2> Will the balloons pop if you sit down while wearing a balloon dress?</h2>
        <p> Well, yes and no. Nothing is stopping you from simply sitting down while wearing the dress, but you do reserve the risk to potentially break the back of your dress. Typically, balloon dress makers will avoid placing large flashy designs at the back, as doing so would increase the chances of breakage. If you happen to be wearing a balloon dress one day, I highly recommend sitting down gently, perhaps with assistance if you're able to. I mean, it must be your special day if you find it in your heart to wear a balloon dress out in public!</p>

<h2> These dresses can be expensive! How much do they really cost?</h2>
        <p> It really depends on your retailer, or who, specifically, you purchase them from. Usually, small businesses tend to charge more money, as the owner relies on no one but one or two employees to assist their craftsmanship, whilst large corporations have thousands of workers working for lower wages. We're in a pandemic right now, so supporting a small business is definitely the way to go! Overall, these dresses can range from 500 dollars to 1000 dollars on AVERAGE. </p>
<h2> Latex allergy? Be careful or stay away!</h2>
        <p> Most balloons do have latex, unless stated otherwise. In fact, some balloon packages even advertise as "latex balloons." You should always ask your balloon dress artisan for the ingredients of the balloons or their provider. Some businesses will even comepnsate or fulfill your request to make a dress with latex free balloons. Given that a dress is meant to cover a large majority of the body, you wouldn't want to break out in rashes or hives from an allergic reaction, so be careful! </p>
