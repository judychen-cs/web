<h1>Adenine</h1>    
      <h3>Structure</h3>
<div class="bodyparasadenine">
        <p>Adenine, composed of five carbons, five hydrogens, and five nitrogens, classifies as a purine. A purine is a nitrogenous base that consists of two rings, which has the potential to promote the production of uric acid on oxidation. When present in deoxyribonucleic acid, the purine binds with the pyrimidineâ€”thymine. Alternatively, when the purine is present in ribonuleic acid, the complementary base becomes uracil.</p>

      <h3>Alternative Functions</h3>
<div class="bodyparasadenine">
        <p>Well, humans share 99.9% of their DNA with each other, and 44.1% with bananas. No, your sibling is not a banana, but all life on Earth can be traced back to common ancestors in phylogenetic trees.</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic trees help with determining evolutionary relatedness between species, but not between you and your distant cousin; that is because you two are part of the same species (hopefully).</p>
