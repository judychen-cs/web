        <h3>Welcome!<h3>
<div class="bodyparashome">
        <p>My name is Judy, and I am a huge biology euthusiast. Calling myself a biologist is way too much pressure and unnecessary strain, so euthusiast will do. This website will be all about the four main bases of DNA (disregarding the uncommon anomalies)â€”including adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. Although all four bases may appear to just be DNA bases, they actually contribute so much more to the living world around us. Look through all of the navigational bar pages for a deeper insight into the function, structure, and fun facts on the four bases.</p>

        <h3>What Exactly is Deoxyribonucleic Acid?</h3>
<div class="bodyparashome">
        <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid, more commonly known as DNA, is what makes you and I different, yet more similar that we could ever expect.</p>
</div>
      <h3>What do I mean, you may ask?</h3>
<div class="bodyparashome">
        <p>Well, humans share 99.9% of their DNA with each other, and 44.1% with bananas. No, your sibling is not a banana, but all life on Earth can be traced back to common ancestors in phylogenetic trees.</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic trees help with determining evolutionary relatedness between species, but not between you and your distant cousin; that is because you two are part of the same species (hopefully).</p>
