<h3>Masayoshi Matsumoto</h3>

The artist has racked up over one hundred thousand followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/isopresso_balloon/?hl=en">Instagram</a>. They are known for creating intricate designs of just about any non-human creature you could think of, from bug larvae to guinea pigs. My personal favorite is the sloth. </p>

  <h3>Jeffrey L. Koons</h3>
        <p> re in a pandemic right now, so supporting a small business is definitely the way to go! Overall, these dresses can range from 500 dollars to 1000 dollars on AVERAGE. </p>
<h3> Latex allergy? Be careful or stay away!</h3>
        <p> Most balloons do have latex, unless stated otherwise. In fact, some balloon packages even advertise as "latex balloons." You should always ask your balloon dress artisan for the ingredients of the balloons or their provider. Some businesses will even comepnsate or fulfill your request to make a dress with latex free balloons. Given that a dress is meant to cover a large majority of the body, you wouldn't want to break out in rashes or hives from an allergic reaction, so be careful! </p>
