      <h3>Structure</h3>
<div class="bodyparasguanine">
        <p>Guanine, a purine, pairs with cytosine during replication. A single molecule unit of guanine is made up of five carbons, five hydrogens, five nitrogens, and one oxygen. When bound together to cytosine, the complex tends to span a shorter length than a complex involving adenine and thymine, as there are only two hydrogen bonds between G and C.</p>

      <h3>The Importance of Guanosine Triphosphate</h3>
<div class="bodyparasguanine">
        <p>Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) sounds a lot like the previously mentioned adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but exhibits differences that allow it to fulfill different functions. For example, GTP is a crucial part of signal transduction pathways, the way cells communicate and facilitate homeostasis. When guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is displaced by GTP, an active G protein will change the shape of a membrane transport channel, activating its mechanism.</p>

      <ul>
   <li>Julius Bodo Unger completed the first isolation of guanine in 1844. The material he obtained it from guano, serving as an inspiration for the name guanine.</li>
   <li>The pearly effect of shampoos and other cosmetic products can be derived from guanine.</li>
