<h3>Significance of Balloon Art</h3>
        <p>Unlike other forms of art, balloon art does not originate from one specific place or culture. Rather, it stems from a variety of different events and groups. According to Wikipedia, "The 1975 book by "Jolly the Clown" Art Petri credits "Herman Bonnert from Pennsylvania at a magician's convention in 1939" as being the first balloontwister.[1] Val Andrews, in Manual of Balloon Modeling, Vol. 1, An Encyclopedic Series, credits H.J. Bonnert of Scranton, Pennsylvania as being the "daddy of them all".[2] Jim Church III states, "Frank Zacone from Youngstown, Ohio was doing a balloon act during the 1940s and had been doing the act for some time."[2] Another candidate for first balloon twister is Henry Maar." In addition to this, balloon art become widely acccessible after hitting mainstream media for a short period of time.</p>
