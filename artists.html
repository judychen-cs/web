<h3>Masayoshi Matsumoto</h3>
        <p> Masayoshi Matsumoto is a Japanese balloon artist based in Yokohama, Japan. The artist has racked up over one hundred thousand followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/isopresso_balloon/?hl=en">Instagram</a>. They are known for creating intricate designs of just about any non-human creature you could think of, from bug larvae to guinea pigs. My personal favorite is the sloth. </p>
  <h3>Jeffrey L. Koons</h3>
        <p> Jeffrey L. Koons is known for his depiction of balloon dogs, which are produced in stainless steel with mirror-finish surfaces. His art has been featured in multiple art exhibits throughout the United States, from The Broad in Los Angeles to The Museum of Modern Art here in NYC. I've been to The Broad in Los Angeles, and his large creations are truly impressive (and expensive).</p>
