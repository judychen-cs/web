    <h1>Zooming Out Of A Virtual Escape Room!</h1>
    <h2>Judy Chen and Esther Kim, Period 5</h2>

	<h3>Project Description</h3>
	<p>
	For our project, we made a virtual escape room. It is a text based adventure, 
	where the player interacts with the environment through text. The game takes 
	place in an abandoned airport and you can move around between different rooms. 
	The main goal, as it is with typical escape rooms, is to escape from the 
	abandoned airport. We also have included a function that will save the player's 
	story as a text file on their computer if they choose to do so. In addition, 
	if the player would like to try making their own scenario, they could insert 
	some text and a escape room scenario would be created.
	</p>

	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<p>
	Type in "open_abandoned_airport()" in the shell to start the game.
	The game takes place in the shell, where a scene will be described and then 
	a question will be asked of the player. The player will be given two answer 
	choices that they can choose from. The player will type in an answer and press 
	enter. Based on which answer selection was chosen, a new scenario will be 
	described. The goal of the escape room is to find the 3 letter code that will 
	unlock the door of the airport. There are hints throughout the game, so pay 
	attention to the scenes described. Chose answers carefully as they do influence 
	the story. To save the story that the player has played through, type in 
	"full()" in the shell and a file titled "python_complete_story.txt" with the 
	story will be saved in the same directory where the python code is saved in. 
	To try generating a unique scenario, the player can insert a piece of text into 
	the function, scenario(text), and a scenario will be created.
	</p>
      
	  
	<h3>How it works</h3>
	<p>
	The whole list of scenarios and mapping of answers to scenarios was planned 
	out. The scenes were split up into strings and placed into different functions. 
	After the description of the scenario was printed, the input function was used to receive 
	info from the player. The input was set equal to a variable and based on what 
	response was given, it led to a new function with a new scenario and a new 
	question asked by using the input function. If an input that was not one of 
	the answer choices is given, a string prompting the player to input a valid 
	answer is printed and the scenario is given again by recursion. There are certain 
	choices that can lead to a game over, so we have implemented a respawn function that 
	leads to a certain base scenario, a sort of checkpoint, so that the player 
	does not have to go through the introduction again. For the full() function, where 
	the player is able to save a text file with the adventure they went through, we 
	made a global variable that is used in almost all the functions. It is an empty 
	string and each time a function is run, the scenario text is added to the string. 
	To edit the variable in the function, we declared that it was a global variable 
	in the function. When the full() function is run in the shell, a file is created 
	and the global variable is written into the file and then saved on the computer. 
	For the scenario, we made a dictionary of words by setting the key equal to a word 
	and the values equal to a word after the key. This was done to our abandoned 
	airport escape room and then a whatever text the player adds in. Then a random 
	key is selected and a random value that is related to the key. These words are 
	added into a string and the value is used as a new key. This continues on until 
	a word with a question mark is reached. This is supposed to resemble our game, 
	where a scene would be described and a question is asked at the end. Then, the 
	string is printed for the player to see.

	<h3>Files</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>final.html: This website file.</li>
	  <li>pytp.css: This is the stylesheet for this website.</li>
	  <li>TAoTS.txt: A text file of the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. 
	  This is used to test and demonstrate how our scenario function works.</li>
	  <li>CompSci Story File.txt: A text file of our scenarios. This is used for the 
	  scenario function, so that a mix of our the escape room and some text will 
	  produce a new scenario.</li>
	  <li>adventure.py: This is where we wrote the python program for our game.</li>
	</ul>

		<ul>We used this website to learn how we could take a string in python and create a file with it. We use this to convert the story the player goes 
		through into a text file, so that if the player chooses to do so, they may save it.</ul>

	  <li>Global Variables: <a href = "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-keyword">https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-keyword</a>
		<ul>We used this website to learn how to use a global variable inside a function so that the function could modify it.</ul>

	<h3>Bugs, Errors, and Things to be Aware of</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    When answering the questions, you must answer using the answer choices provided. 
		The answers are case sensitive, so you are advised to write answers exactly as 
		they are shown.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		When using the scenario() function, the scenario may not making sense as the two 
		text being combined may not fuse nicely.
	  </li>
	</ul>
