<h1>Deoxyribonucleic Acid</h1>
      <h3>What Exactly is Deoxyribonucleic Acid?</h3>
<div class="bodyparashome">
        <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid, more commonly known as DNA, is what makes you and I different, yet more similar that we could ever expect.</p>
</div>
      <h3>What do I mean, you may ask?</h3>
<div class="bodyparashome">
        <p>Well, humans share 99.9% of their DNA with each other, and 44.1% with bananas. No, your sibling is not a banana, but all life on Earth can be traced back to common ancestors in phylogenetic trees.</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic trees help with determining evolutionary relatedness between species, but not between you and your distant cousin; that is because you two are part of the same species (hopefully).</p>
