<h2> Will the balloons pop if you sit down while wearing a balloon dress?</h2>
        <p> Well, yes and no. Nothing is stopping you from simply sitting down while wearing the dress, but you do reserve the risk to potentially break the back of your dress. Typically, balloon dress makers will avoid placing large flashy designs at the back, as doing so would increase the chances of breakage. If you happen to be wearing a balloon dress one day, I highly recommend sitting down gently, perhaps with assistance if you're able to. I mean, it must be your special day if you find it in your heart to wear a balloon dress out in public!</p>
