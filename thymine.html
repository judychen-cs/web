<h1>Thymine</h1>    
      <h3>Structure</h3>
<div class="bodyparasthymine">
        <p>Thymine is a pyrimidine composed of five carbons, six hydrogens, two nitrogens, and two oxygens. Like other pyrimidines, thymine only has one ring as opposed to the two in purines. The thymine ring is a heterocyclic ring, referring to the existence of atoms besides carbon within the ring.

      <h3>Thymine's Role in Cancer and Mutations</h3>
<div class="bodyparasthymine">
        <p>Theoretically, all the general branches of “genetic mutations” have the ability to manifest pathogenetically. For the sake of time and clarity, we will talk about the specific thymine dimer that is triggered by the presence of ultraviolet light; this is in fact, how skin cancer can occur. When exposed to UV (ultraviolet) rays, two thymines may bond together to form a dimer, which can in turn prevent proper replication and transcription. Usually, this is fixed by nucleotide excision repair or by photolyase reactivation—but not guaranteed.</p>

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<div class="bodyparasthymine">
      <ul>
   <li>Thymine is also known as 5-methyluracil.</li>
   <li>Thymine has been formed under outer space conditions (atmosphere composition, average temperature, etc.), leading scientists to believe that life may exist extraterrestrially. This is similar to adenine.</li>
      </ul>
