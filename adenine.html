<h1>Adenine</h1>

      <h3>Structure</h3>
<div class="bodyparasadenine">
        <p>Adenine, composed of five carbons, five hydrogens, and five nitrogens, classifies as a purine. A purine is a nitrogenous base that consists of two rings, which has the potential to promote the production of uric acid on oxidation. When present in deoxyribonucleic acid, the purine binds with the pyrimidine—thymine. Alternatively, when the purine is present in ribonuleic acid, the complementary base becomes uracil.</p> 
</div>
      <h3>Alternative Functions</h3>
<div class="bodyparasadenine">
        <p>Our purine friend can be found in the form of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Adenosine triphosphate has the capacity to phosphorylate other molecules, releasing energy in the process. A living organism like you (again, hopefully) requires energy for nearly every task—voluntary or involuntary. One example of a process that requires energy is protein synthesis, where energy fuels all methods of active transport and enzymatic catalysis.</p>
        <p>Without protein synthesis, you would have no capacity to resemble a human, so you’d probably look like some type of blobfish. Just kidding, even blobfish rely on protein synthesis (however ugly they may be), so you would just not exist.</p>

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<div class="bodyparasadenine">
      <ul>
   <li>The melting point of adenine ranges from 360 to 365 centigrade.</li>
   <li>Before extensive research, adenine was referred to as vitamin B4. However, we now know that it is unneeded in diet and synthesized by the body, so it is not referred to as a vitamin anymore.</li>
   <li>From NASA findings on meteorites, we can conclude that adenine and other organic molecules may be formed extraterrestrially.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
<div class="bodyparasadenine">
        <p>Adenine is often mentioned in pharmaceutical matters, as many other molecules are as well. The <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00173"><pharmacodynamics> of this drug is based off of its ability to serve as an coenzyme component. This is super interesting, as it depicts how the ins and outs of organic chemistry relate to overall public health and medicine accessibility.</p>
