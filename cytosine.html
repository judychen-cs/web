      <h3>Structure</h3>
<div class="bodyparascytosine">
        <p>Cytosine, like thymine, is also a pyrimidine. One cytosine molecule consists of four carbons, five hydrogens, three nitrogens, and one oxygen. When it is in the form of cytidine triphosphate, it has multiple abilities: acting as an enzymatic cofactor, or transferring an extra phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP).</p>

      <h3>Cytosine's Methylation</h3>
<div class="bodyparascytosine">
        <p>This specific nitrogenous base brings the talk of epigenetics to the table. Epigenetics is the study of heritable phenotypic anomalies that do not involve a change in DNA sequence, usually as a result of the environment. During the process of methylation, methyl groups can attach to cytosine, causing gene silencing; the specific gene or sequence impacted by methylation can no longer be transcribed.</p>
        <p>In addition to the thymine dimers, cytosine methylation can also cause cancer manifestation. For instance, if methylation impacts a tumor suppressor gene, this may hinder cellular repair functions from recognizing other genetic mutationsâ€”if the cell does not go into apoptosis, rapid division prompts tumors (benign or malignant).</p>

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<div class="bodyparascytosine">
      <ul>
   <li>Cytosine has a melting point of 320 to 325 centigrade.</li>
   <li>The nucleotide is also referred to as 4-amino-1H-pyrimidine-2-one.</li>
